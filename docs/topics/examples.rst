This library contains a few example applications of event sourcing in Python.


.. _Example aggregates:

Example aggregates
==================

The aggregate examples show a range of different styles for coding aggregate
classes, from the declarative syntax which provides the most concise style
for expressing business concerns, to a functional style which uses immutable
aggregate objects. All these examples make use of the library's application
and persistence modules. All these examples satisfy the same test case which
involves creating and updating a ``Dog`` aggregate, and taking a snapshot.
