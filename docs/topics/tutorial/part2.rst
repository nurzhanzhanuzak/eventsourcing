Tutorial - Part 2 - Aggregates
==============================

This part of the tutorial shows in more detail how to define event-sourced aggregates.

In :doc:`Part 1 </topics/tutorial/part1>` we learned
how to write event-sourced aggregates and applications
in Python.

Now let's look at how event-sourced aggregates work in more detail.

Aggregates in more detail
=========================

We can define event-sourced aggregates with the library's :class:`~eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate` class
and :func:`@event<eventsourcing.domain.event>` decorator.

.. code-block:: python

    from eventsourcing.domain import Aggregate, event

Let's define the simplest possible event-sourced aggregate, by
simply subclassing :class:`~eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate`.

.. code-block:: python

    class Dog(Aggregate):
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            pass


In the usual way with Python classes, we can create a new instance by
calling the class.

.. code-block:: python

    dog = Dog()

    assert isinstance(dog, Dog)


The ``dog`` aggregate has an ``id`` attribute. The ID is used to uniquely identify
the aggregate within a collection of aggregates. It happens to be a UUID.

.. code-block:: python

    from uuid import UUID

    assert isinstance(dog.id, UUID)


Normally an instance is constructed directly when a Python class is called.
However, when a subclass of :class:`~eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate` is called, the aggregate instance
is constructed indirectly. Firstly, an event object is constructed. The event
object represents the fact that the aggregate was "created". Secondly, this
event object is used to construct the aggregate instance. The aggregate
instance is then returned to the caller of the class. The reason for this
two-stage process is so the event object can be recorded and used in future
to reconstruct the initial state of the aggregate.

The "created" event object is held by the aggregate in an internal list of
"pending events". We can collect pending events from aggregates by calling
the aggregate's :func:`~eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate.collect_events` method, which is defined on the
:class:`~eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate` base class.

.. code-block:: python

    events = dog.collect_events()

    assert len(events) == 1

The "created" event object can be used to reconstruct the aggregate.

To reconstruct the aggregate from the event, we can call the event's :func:`~eventsourcing.domain.CanMutateAggregate.mutate`
method.

.. code-block:: python

    copy = events[0].mutate(None)

    assert copy is not None
    assert copy.id == dog.id

Using events to determine the state of an aggregate is the essence of event
sourcing.

Next, let's talk about aggregate events in more detail.

.. _Created events:

"Created" events
================

When the ``Dog`` aggregate code is interpreted by Python, a "created" event
class is automatically defined for the aggregate. The event class is defined
as a nested class.

By default, the name of the "created" event class is ``'Created'``. And
so the event we collected from the aggregate is an instance of ``Dog.Created``.

.. code-block:: python

    assert isinstance(Dog.Created, type)
    assert isinstance(events[0], Dog.Created)


We can specify a name for the "created" event class by using the :func:`@event<eventsourcing.domain.event>`
decorator on the aggregate's ``__init__()`` method.

Let's specify the name of the "created" event class to be ``'Registered'``.
The changes are highlighted below.

..
    #include-when-testing
..
    from eventsourcing.utils import clear_topic_cache
    clear_topic_cache()
    #del Dog

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 2

    class Dog(Aggregate):
        @event('Registered')
        def __init__(self) -> None:
            pass

We can see the ``Dog`` class has a nested class ``Dog.Registered``.

.. code-block:: python

    assert isinstance(Dog.Registered, type)

Now, after we call the aggregate class, a ``Dog.Registered``
event is collected from the aggregate instance.

.. code-block:: python

    dog = Dog()
    events = dog.collect_events()

    assert len(events) == 1
    assert isinstance(events[0], Dog.Registered)


Let's adjust the ``__init__()`` method to accept a ``name``
argument, and to initialise a ``name`` attribute with the
given value of the argument. The changes are highlighted below.

..
    #include-when-testing
..
    clear_topic_cache()
    #del Dog

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 3-4

    class Dog(Aggregate):
        @event('Registered')
        def __init__(self, name: str):
            self.name = name

Now, when we call the ``Dog`` class, we need to provide a value for
the ``name`` argument.

..
    #include-when-testing
..
    import eventsourcing.utils
    eventsourcing.utils._topic_cache.clear()

.. code-block:: python

    dog = Dog(name='Fido')


When the aggregate class is called, a "created" event object is
constructed and used to to construct an aggregate instance.
The body of the ``__init__()`` method is used by the "created" event object
to initialise the aggregate instance. As a result, the aggregate instance's
``name`` attribute has the value given when calling the aggregate class.

We can see the aggregate instance ``dog`` has an attribute ``name``, which
has the value given when calling the aggregate class.

.. code-block:: python

    assert dog.name == 'Fido'


We can call :func:`~eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate.collect_events` to get the "created" event from
the aggregate instance.

.. code-block:: python

    events = dog.collect_events()

    assert len(events) == 1

We can see the event object is an instance of the class ``Dog.Registered``.

.. code-block:: python

    assert isinstance(events[0], Dog.Registered)

The event class ``Dog.Registered`` is a subclass of the base class :class:`Aggregate.Created <eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate.Created>`.

.. code-block:: python

    assert issubclass(Dog.Registered, Aggregate.Created)


Event classes defined by the :func:`@event<eventsourcing.domain.event>` decorator match the decorated
method signature. Each parameter of the method signature will be matched by an
event object attribute. Since the ``__init__()`` method signature has
a ``name`` argument, so the "created" event has a ``name`` attribute.

We can see the "created" event object has a ``name`` attribute, which has the
value given when calling the aggregate class, and which is the value that was used
when initialising the aggregate instance.

.. code-block:: python

    assert events[0].name == 'Fido'

The construction of the aggregate instance is mediated by the "created" event
object, so that we can store the event object in a database, and so that the aggregate
instance can be reconstructed in future from stored events.

The "created" event object can be used to construct another object with the
same state as the original aggregate object. That is, it can be used to
reconstruct the initial state of the aggregate.

.. code-block:: python

    copy = events[0].mutate(None)

    assert copy is not None
    assert copy.id == dog.id
    assert copy.name == dog.name

Note what happens when we call :func:`~eventsourcing.domain.CanMutateAggregate.mutate`. We start with ``None`` and
end up with an instance of ``Dog`` that has the same state as the original
``dog`` object. Note also that ``dog`` and ``copy`` are different objects
with the same type and state, not two references to the same Python object.

.. code-block:: python

    assert id(copy) != id(dog)


In this section, we specified a "created" event class by decorating the
``__init__()`` method of an aggregate class with the :func:`@event<eventsourcing.domain.event>` decorator.
When the aggregate class was called, a "created" event object was constructed
and used to construct an aggregate instance. The "created" event object
was used to reconstruct the initial state of the aggregate.

We can take this further by defining aggregate command methods that change
the state of an aggregate, and subsequent event classes so the command
methods can operate in an event-sourced style.

.. _Subsequent events:

Subsequent events
=================

Aggregate command methods change the state of an aggregate after it has
been created. When the command method of an event-sourced aggregate is called,
rather than the method body being executed directly, instead an aggregate event
object can be constructed and used to execute the method body. The event object
can then be used in future to reconstruct the state of an aggregate that has been
changed after it was created.

Let's continue to develop the ``Dog`` class, by defining an ``add_trick()``
method. This method appends a given ``trick`` to a list of tricks that
a dog has been trained to perform. This method is decorated with :func:`@event<eventsourcing.domain.event>`
decorator, so that an event class will be defined, and so that an event object
will be constructed when the method is called. The event object will use the
method body to change the state of the aggregate. The name of the event class
is specified to be ``'TrickAdded'``. We also need to adjust the ``__init__()``
method, to initialise a ``tricks`` attribute with an empty list. The changes are
highlighted below.

..
    #include-when-testing
..
    clear_topic_cache()
    #del Dog

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 5,7-9

    class Dog(Aggregate):
        @event('Registered')
        def __init__(self, name: str):
            self.name = name
            self.tricks: list[str] = []

        @event('TrickAdded')
        def add_trick(self, trick: str) -> None:
            self.tricks.append(trick)


Because the ``add_trick()`` method is decorated with the :func:`@event<eventsourcing.domain.event>` decorator,
an event class ``Dog.TrickAdded`` is defined on the aggregate class.

.. code-block:: python

    assert isinstance(Dog.TrickAdded, type)


The event class ``Dog.TrickAdded`` is a subclass of the base class :class:`Aggregate.Event <eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate.Event>`.

.. code-block:: python

    assert issubclass(Dog.TrickAdded, Aggregate.Event)


Let's call the ``Dog`` class to create a new aggregate.

..
    #include-when-testing
..
    import eventsourcing.utils
    eventsourcing.utils._topic_cache.clear()

.. code-block:: python

    dog = Dog(name='Fido')

The aggregate's attribute ``name`` has the value ``'Fido'``.
The attribute ``tricks`` is an empty list.

.. code-block:: python

    assert dog.name == 'Fido'
    assert dog.tricks == []

Now let's call the ``add_trick()`` method with ``'roll over'`` as the value of the
argument ``trick``.

.. code-block:: python

    dog.add_trick(trick='roll over')


The ``tricks`` attribute is now a list with one item, ``'roll over'``.

.. code-block:: python

    assert dog.tricks == ['roll over']

Creating and updating the aggregate caused two events to occur.
We can collect these two events by calling :func:`~eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate.collect_events`.

.. code-block:: python

    events = dog.collect_events()

    assert len(events) == 2

A ``Dog.Registered`` event object was constructed when the ``Dog`` class
was called. And a ``Dog.TrickAdded`` event object was constructed when
the ``add_trick()`` method was called.

.. code-block:: python

    assert isinstance(events[0], Dog.Registered)
    assert isinstance(events[1], Dog.TrickAdded)

The signatures of the decorated methods are used to define event classes.
When the method is called, the values of the method arguments are used to
construct an event object.

We can see the ``Dog.Registered`` event has a ``name`` attribute and the
``Dog.TrickAdded`` event has a ``trick`` attribute. The values of these
attributes are the values that were given when the methods were called.

.. code-block:: python

    assert events[0].name == 'Fido'
    assert events[1].trick == 'roll over'

Calling a method constructs an event. The event updates the aggregate by
executing the decorated method body. The resulting state of the aggregate
is the same as if the method were not decorated. The important difference
is that a sequence of events is generated. This sequence of events can be
used in future to reconstruct the current state of the aggregate, as shown
below.

.. code-block:: python

    copy = None
    for e in events:
        copy = e.mutate(copy)

    assert copy.id == dog.id
    assert copy.name == dog.name
    assert copy.tricks == dog.tricks

You can try all of this for yourself by copying the code snippets above.

Explicitly defined event classes
================================

In the discussion so far, aggregate event classes have been defined implicitly
to match a method signature. Although that is the most concise style, you may
want or need to define aggregate event classes explicitly.

The example below shows the ``Dog`` aggregate class defined with explicit
event classes. The :func:`@event<eventsourcing.domain.event>` decorator is used to specify the event class
that will be triggered when the decorated method is called.

The ``Dog.Registered`` class inherits :class:`Aggregate.Created <eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate.Created>`. It has a
``name`` attribute which matches the ``name`` argument of the ``__init__()`` method.

The ``Dog.TrickAdded`` class inherits :class:`Aggregate.Event <eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate.Event>` class. It has a ``trick``
attribute which matches the ``trick`` argument of the ``add_trick()`` method.

The event class definitions are interpreted as `Python data classes <https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html>`_.

..
    #include-when-testing
..
    clear_topic_cache()
    #del Dog

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 2,3,5,10,11,13

    class Dog(Aggregate):
        class Registered(Aggregate.Created):
            name: str

        @event(Registered)
        def __init__(self, name: str):
            self.name = name
            self.tricks: list[str] = []

        class TrickAdded(Aggregate.Event):
            trick: str

        @event(TrickAdded)
        def add_trick(self, trick: str) -> None:
            self.tricks.append(trick)


The important things to remember are:

* the :func:`@event<eventsourcing.domain.event>` decorator specifies the event class itself,
* the "created" event class must be a subclass of :class:`Aggregate.Created <eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate.Created>`,
* subsequent event classes must be subclasses of :class:`Aggregate.Event <eventsourcing.domain.Aggregate.Event>`, and
* the event class attributes must match the decorated method arguments.

We can use the aggregate class in the same way.

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a dog.
    dog = Dog(name='Fido')

    assert dog.name == 'Fido'
    assert dog.tricks == []

    # Add trick.
    dog.add_trick(trick='roll over')

    assert dog.tricks == ['roll over']

    # Reconstruct aggregate from events.
    copy = None
    for e in dog.collect_events():
        copy = e.mutate(copy)

    assert copy.id == dog.id
    assert copy.name == dog.name
    assert copy.tricks == dog.tricks

One reason for defining event classes explicitly is, as a matter of style, to be explicit
about the event classes. Another reason is to code for versioning of the event class, see
:ref:`Versioning <Versioning>` in the :doc:`domain </topics/domain>` module documentation
for more details. Another reason is to have an explicit class definition to reference in
event processing policies.

Decorating private methods
==========================

Often an aggregate command method will need to do some work before an event
is triggered.

If an aggregate command method needs to do some work on its arguments before
triggering an event, the :func:`@event<eventsourcing.domain.event>` decorator can be used on a "private" method
that is called by the "public" command method after the work has been done. The
"private" method can have a completely different method signature from the "public"
method.

The example below shows a ``Dog`` aggregate class with an undecorated "public"
command method ``add_trick()`` that calls a decorated "private" method ``_add_trick()``.

..
    #include-when-testing
..
    clear_topic_cache()
    #del Dog

.. code-block:: python

    class Dog(Aggregate):
        def __init__(self, name: str):
            self.name = name
            self.tricks: list[str] = []

        def add_trick(self, trick: str) -> None:
            # Do some work.
            assert isinstance(trick, str)
            # Trigger event.
            self._add_trick(trick=trick)

        @event('TrickAdded')
        def _add_trick(self, trick: str) -> None:
            self.tricks.append(trick)


Because the "public" command method ``add_trick()`` is not decorated with the
:func:`@event<eventsourcing.domain.event>` decorator, it does not trigger an event when it is called. Instead, the
event is triggered when the "private" method ``_add_trick()`` is called by the
"public" method.

..
    #include-when-testing
..
    import eventsourcing.utils
    eventsourcing.utils._topic_cache.clear()

.. code-block:: python

    # Create a dog.
    dog = Dog(name='Fido')
    assert dog.name == 'Fido'
    assert dog.tricks == []

    # Add trick.
    dog.add_trick(trick='roll over')
    assert dog.tricks == ['roll over']

    # Add trick - wrong type of argument.
    try:
        dog.add_trick(trick=101)
    except AssertionError:
        assert dog.tricks == ['roll over']
    else:
        raise AssertionError("Shouldn't get here")

    # Reconstruct aggregate from events.
    copy = None
    for e in dog.collect_events():
        copy = e.mutate(copy)
    assert copy == dog


Exercises
=========

1. Replicate the code in this tutorial in your development environment.

2. Define a ``Todos`` aggregate, that has a given ``name`` and a list of ``items``.
Define a method ``add_item()`` that adds a new item to the list. Specify the name
of the "created" event to be ``'Started'`` and the name of the subsequent event
to be ``'ItemAdded'``. Copy the test below and make it pass.

..
    #include-when-testing
..
    class Todos(Aggregate):
        @event('Started')
        def __init__(self, name: str):
            self.name = name
            self.items: list[str] = []

        @event('ItemAdded')
        def add_item(self, item: str) -> None:
            self.items.append(item)


.. code-block:: python

    def test() -> None:

        # Start a list of todos, and add some items.
        todos1 = Todos(name='Shopping list')
        todos1.add_item('bread')
        todos1.add_item('milk')
        todos1.add_item('eggs')

        # Check the state of the aggregate.
        assert todos1.name == 'Shopping list'
        assert todos1.items == [
            'bread',
            'milk',
            'eggs',
        ]

        # Check the aggregate events.
        events = todos1.collect_events()
        assert len(events) == 4
        assert isinstance(events[0], Todos.Started)
        assert events[0].name == 'Shopping list'
        assert isinstance(events[1], Todos.ItemAdded)
        assert events[1].item == 'bread'
        assert isinstance(events[2], Todos.ItemAdded)
        assert events[2].item == 'milk'
        assert isinstance(events[3], Todos.ItemAdded)
        assert events[3].item == 'eggs'

        # Reconstruct aggregate from events.
        copy = None
        for e in events:
            copy = e.mutate(copy)
        assert copy == todos1

        # Create and test another aggregate.
        todos2 = Todos(name='Household repairs')
        assert todos1 != todos2
        events = todos2.collect_events()
        assert len(events) == 1
        assert isinstance(events[0], Todos.Started)
        assert events[0].name == 'Household repairs'
        assert events[0].mutate(None) == todos2
