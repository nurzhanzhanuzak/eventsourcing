# Build documentation in the "docs/" directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/conf.py
  # You can configure Sphinx to use a different builder, for instance use the dirhtml builder for simpler URLs

  # fail_on_warning: true

# Optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF and ePub
# formats:
#    - pdf
#    - epub

# Optional but recommended, declare the Python requirements required
# to build your documentation
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/reproducible-builds.html
#python:
#  install:
#    - method: pip
#      path: .
